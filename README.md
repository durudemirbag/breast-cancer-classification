# Breast Cancer Classification with Decision Trees

This repository presents a machine learning study on breast cancer diagnosis
using Decision Tree classifiers, with a focus on the bias–variance trade-off.

The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset is used to classify cases as benign or malignant,
addressing challenges such as class imbalance and model generalisation.

## Project Context

This project was completed as part of an MSc Data Science programme
and is included here to showcase applied machine learning,
model evaluation, and interpretability in a healthcare context.

## Methodology Overview

- Decision Tree classifier for binary classification
- Handling class imbalance using class weighting
- 10-fold cross-validation
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Bias–variance trade-off analysis
- Model evaluation using accuracy, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices
- Feature importance analysis
